# keyboard rhytm game
It's a rhythm game like a osu! only the gameplay takes place only using the keyboard.

At the moment this is the console version of the game.

# gameplay
Click on the corresponding displayed symbol on the screen to the rhythm of the music.

So far, one card is available for a 12 second composition (with the future possibility of betting on a much longer one), a points system and a bunch of terrible code, which I do not recommend getting into.

P.s. The composition must be located in the same folder with the exe file of the program, in wav format and its name must be music1.wav
